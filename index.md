# Sustainable Shopping for the Environmentally Anxious

## Our Mission

Our world is a beautiful place. As humans, we all want to do our part in taking care of it. Well, most of us. 
Specifically if you landed here, I imagine you do. 

Unfortunately, making sustainable choices in the modern day is a hard thing to do. Our world is built 
on consumption and waste. Taking the time to search for alternatives is often so mentally taxing and time 
consuming that the average person simply can't do it. Even those of us with the time and energy can find
it difficult. You jump from site to site and stare at some companies' promises to operate sustainably- 
to donate where they can, to do things *differently*. And you wonder, what makes you different? You're 
still profiting. You could research for hours before you've gotten enough information that you can be 
100% certain you trust a product and company. Or you give up and choose the best that you've found. 

At least thats what I do. Or I sit around staring at plastic products wondering about how relatively recently 
plastic as we know it wasn't a thing??? And we were okay?? I mean plastic is useful and all, but really does 
everything have to be disposable?? 

I'm salty. It shouldn't just be easier to find sustainable products- it should be the norm. You should be able
to do a quick google search and find all the information you need. You should be able to see these products 
front and center in your local store- no matter where you live. And they should be affordable. 

But one thing at a time. I'm making this website as an attempt to help fill the void of information. I will be 
posting articles summarizing my research dives into sustainable products and related subjects. Eventually, my 
goal is to create a comprehensive database that gives you the facts about the quality of a product, its social
and environmental impact, and also the facts about the company that makes it. 

I hope you gain something from this website! Please feel free to contact me with suggesstions for topics, 
resources, etc. If you know something I don't, then please reach out. 

### This website is under construction!
### It will be updated with more information/initial posts in the coming days!
